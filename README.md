# ATM
ATM: Adaptive Temporal Kalman Filter Based Solution Separation Method for Integrity Monitoring

This project is based on several external datasets and frameworks:

- **Dataset**: [IPNL-POLYU](https://github.com/IPNL-POLYU)  
  GNSS/INS datasets for performance evaluation under different motion scenarios.

- **GNSS/INS Tightly Coupled Framework**: [TightlyCoupledINSGNSS](https://github.com/benzenemo/TightlyCoupledINSGNSS.git)  
  Provides tightly-coupled integration of GNSS and INS, improving robustness in challenging environments.

- **MHSS (via MAAST tool)**: [Stanford GPS Lab â€“ MAAST](https://gps.stanford.edu/resources/software-tools/maast)  
  Used for simulation, integrity monitoring, and performance testing.
